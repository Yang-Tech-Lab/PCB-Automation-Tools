为了配合你 Yang-Tech-Lab 在 2026 年春季的正式上线，我们需要将这个 README 从“工具介绍”提升到“工程化解决方案（Engineering Solution）”的高度。
这份改版方案强调了商业溢价和技术闭环，使用了更具工业感的术语，旨在让潜在的 Fiverr 客户在看到仓库的第一眼就产生“专业、高效、可靠”的职业信任。
⚡ PCB-Automation-Suite: The Hardware Consultant's Toolchain
> Bridging the gap between precision electronics and commercial automation.
> 
Administrative overhead is the hidden bottleneck of freelance hardware engineering. PCB-Automation-Suite is an industrial-grade toolchain developed by Yang-Tech-Lab to automate the non-engineering lifecycle of PCB design—from strategic pricing to professional fiscal delivery.
🛠️ Integrated Modules
1. DocuSynth-Hardware (make_invoice.py)
Automated Fiscal Intelligence & PDF Orchestration.
Transforming raw technical quotes into premium client deliverables. This module doesn't just generate a file; it packages your engineering value.
 * Heuristic Calculation: Automated sum estimation for technical complexities (e.g., High-Density Interconnect (HDI), Impedance Control, DFM validation).
 * Precision Formula: Ensures 100% accuracy in total cost calculations using a standardized fiscal logic:
   
 * Commercial Finish: Embeds localized banking details, technical disclaimers, and professional branding.
2. MarketIntelligence-Engine (analyze_price.py)
Data-Driven Strategic Arbitrage.
A competitive analysis tool that identifies market "Blue Oceans." It visualizes competitor volatility to ensure your pricing reflects both your skill and the market's pulse.
 * Statistical Analysis: Processes competitor data via Pandas to identify pricing clusters on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork.
 * Trend Visualization: Renders high-fidelity Matplotlib charts to track market shifts for specific hardware services (e.g., ESP32 IoT vs. High-Speed FPGA layouts).
🚀 Deployment Environment
Prerequisites
 * Python: 3.12+ (Optimized for modern syntax)
 * Libraries: reportlab, pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl
